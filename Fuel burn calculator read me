Python Control Flow :
Title: Fuel burn calculator

Concept:
Calculate total trip fuel based on distance, aircraft fuel flow rate, and reserve policy.
This mimics how dispatchers and FMS calculate required trip fuel.

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
Input:

Distance (in nautical miles)
Aircraft fuel burn rate (in kg/hr)
Average ground speed (in knots)
Reserve time (in minutes)

Compute:
Flight time = Distance / Ground Speed
Trip fuel = Flight Time × Fuel Burn Rate
Reserve fuel = (Reserve Time / 60) × Fuel Burn Rate
Total fuel = Trip fuel + Reserve fuel

Output:
Display Trip Fuel, Reserve Fuel, and Total Fuel.	

Sample Input :
Enter distance (NM): 800
Enter fuel burn rate (kg/hr): 600
Enter average ground speed (knots): 400
Enter reserve time (minutes): 45

Sample output :
--- Fuel Calculation Summary ---
Flight Time      : 2.00 hr
Trip Fuel        : 1200.00 kg
Reserve Fuel     : 450.00 kg
Total Required   : 1650.00 kg
