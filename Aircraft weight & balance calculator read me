Python Control Flow :
Title: Largest of three numbers

Concept:
Basic Equation:
CG=∑(Weight×Arm)∑WeightCG=∑Weight∑(Weight×Arm)
This Python project calculates an aircraft’s **total weight** and **center of gravity (CG)**, ensuring it stays within the operational envelope.  
It simulates the logic used in flight dispatch software and FMS systems.

Steps:
Take inputs for aircraft empty weight and CG.
Add payload (crew, pax, cargo) and fuel.
Calculate total weight and new CG.
Verify limits (for example: within 20–35% MAC).

Tech used :
Language : pyhton
Compiler : Visual Studio Code

Logic Flow:
- Calculates total weight and CG position.  
- Supports crew, passenger, cargo, and fuel entries.  
- Checks if CG is within defined limits.  
- Modular and ready for extension (for different aircraft types).	

Input :
Enter Basic Empty Weight (kg): 3400
Enter Empty CG (m): 3.1
Enter total crew weight (kg): 180
Enter crew arm (m): 2.5
Enter total passenger weight (kg): 420
Enter passenger arm (m): 3.3
Enter total cargo weight (kg): 200
Enter cargo arm (m): 4.0
Enter fuel weight (kg): 500
Enter fuel arm (m): 3.4

Output :
------ WEIGHT & BALANCE SUMMARY ------
Total Weight     : 4700.00 kg
Total Moment     : 15080.00 kg·m
CG Position      : 3.21 m
✅ CG within limits.
